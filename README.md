<h1>Sleep Debt Calculator</h1>

<b>Did you know that giraffes sleep 4.6 hours a day? We humans need more than that.  If we donâ€™t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. In this project we will calculate if you are getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.
This program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.
Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly sleep goal.
